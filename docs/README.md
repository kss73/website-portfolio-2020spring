# Project 3: Website Portfolio

"Shah's cup of coffee" is a pretend coffee shop I have designed as for my love for coffee! I have included a Home page, Menu page, Careers page, Contact Us page, and Reviews page. I have tried my best to make each page unique from one another while also making sure it as an aesthetic look. I used many different pictures of coffee and tried to keep the colors and fonts as simple as possible to make it visually appealing. 
This website is targeted towards a wide range of audience. Anyone that is a big fan of coffee and nature will
love to come here. I have a love for coffee and spend most of my days studying in Starbucks or looking for other coffee 
shops to do work at.
